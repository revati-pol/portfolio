      <h2> So, Who Am I ? </h2>

      <div className="container story__container">
        <p>
          In the realm of academia, I pursued a <b>Bachelor's degree in Political
          Science</b>, a path that offered me insights into Philosophy, English
          Literature, Psychology, Journalism, and, of course, the intricate
          world of Politics. While many of my peers aspired to traditional paths
          such as UPSC, Government Exams, Teaching, or Law, I felt a
          pull towards the technology field, a realm that seemed vastly
          different from my academic background.

        <p>
          The catalyst for my transition into the tech world was my elder
          sister, an IT Engineer who became my guiding light throughout this
          journey. Her encouragement and support fuelled my passion for
          technology, inspiring me to embrace the unknown and take risks. Iâ€™ve
          always been someone who follows my instincts, and in this case, I
          wanted to carve out a unique path distinct from my classmates. I
          thrive on taking risks and embracing challenges, curious about how I
          would handle the decisions I made.

          Reflecting on my three years of study, I take immense pride in the
          diverse knowledge I gained. My education encompassed Philosophy,
          English Literature, Psychology, Political Science, and Journalism.
          Each subject has equipped me with a different lens through which I can
          view the world, and I am eager to apply this knowledge to my future
          career. Understanding Human Behavior, Political Dynamics, and
          Strategic Thinking are invaluable tools I plan to utilize in the tech
          landscape. I firmly believe that no knowledge or degree is wasted;
          it's all about knowing how and where to apply what you've learned.

          I embarked on my tech journey in April 2023, shortly after graduation,
          by learning <b>CCNA</b>. I realized that foundational knowledge of networking
          is essential for anyone entering the IT field. Following that, I
          tackled Python as my first programming language, immersing myself in
          the world of coding. Initially, my plan was to venture into the Cloud
          Domain. I started learning AWS, envisioning a career in DevOps.
          However, I soon discovered that the cloud sector often favors
          experienced professionals. As a fresher and coming from a Non-IT
          background, I recognized that I might not be the first choice for such
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This realization led me to pivot my focus to <b>Full Stack Web
          Development</b>. I dedicated nearly eight months to mastering various
          technologies, immersing myself in every aspect of web development.
          This commitment has now evolved into a focus on building multiple
          full-stack projects while continually refining my skills. As I
          complete my first year in the tech field, I am excited to announce my
          plans to dive into <b>AWS</b> since the demand for cloud expertise is undeniable, 
          and I am determined to enhance my skill set in this area.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey has been filled with struggles, but I believe the hustle
          will pay off. I aim to stand out in a field where I began as a novice.
          My unique perspective, shaped by my non-Tech background, allows me to
          approach challenges creatively and strategically.
        </p>

          Thank you for taking the time to read my story; I look forward to what
          the future holds!
